## Question

[Code version Management/Control]How sync your salesforce code to Github/bitbucket?





## Situation

Version control, for most developers, is an absolute must in any professional setting. However, currently, in salesforce org, there dont have Code version Management/Control. 
One solution is using plug-in(Subversion) for Eclipse, but it need the deveploer to install Eclipse in their local machine.




## Solution


Today, I will introduce one solution which is using unix+ nodejs to retrieve salesforce code and then push the code to Githut/Bitbucket.



**Method**


Firstly, I will setup my linux workspace, there, I use cloud9. Also, you can use your local machine.

Secondly, I will retrieve all code-related metadata in salesforce, this include lightning component, apex Component/Visual force page, class. and tigger .

Thirdly, I will push all related code to the Githut/Bitbucket.

All above steps will be like following.
