To log the record, we may use 'System.debug('somethings');' to print the information,but we can also use following method to save the log .

**Sending Email Method**
{% include GistCode.html id="67721ffcf9d7ed806d3fb521e3c62a15" %}

**Insert Record Method**

If we want to insert the log into one object, we can insert our log into Attachment also:


{% include GistCode.html id="fcec1bb7cdd4d2e1b23d929e683be81e" %}

Please note that we need to create object name 'Log__c' to save the record.
